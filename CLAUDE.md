# Standout Social — Landing Page Factory

## Skills (Core Intelligence)
The following Skills power this system. Claude Code will auto-discover them based on context, or you can reference them directly:

| Skill | What It Does | Trigger |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `unicorn-conversion-engine` | Full 4-phase landing page pipeline (Discovery → Copy → Expert Review → Deploy) | "new page", "build a page", "run UCE" |
| `expert-review-panel` | 10-expert scoring panel, 90+ gate to ship | "review the page", "run the panel", "score this" |
| `brand-extraction` | Extract colors, fonts, styles from any URL | "extract brand", "pull brand colors" |
| `ad-creative-pipeline` | Generate 12-18 Meta ad creatives across 6 styles | "generate ads", "make ad creatives" |
| `qa-reviewer` | Technical QA: visual, content, technical, brand checks | "QA this page", "check for bugs" |

**Skills live at:** `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

## Memory
All memory is in `memory/` at workspace root. Load relevant client profile before starting any client work.

## Session Start Protocol
1. Read `memory/glossary.md` for CSS lessons learned
2. Read `memory/context/` for reusable patterns and technical gotchas
3. If working on a specific client, load `memory/clients/{client}.md`

## Session End Protocol
1. If you learned something reusable (CSS fix, pattern, gotcha), add it to the appropriate memory file
2. Update `memory/clients/{client}.md` if client-specific data was verified
3. Update `.claude/agent-memory/qa-reviewer/MEMORY.md` if brand data was verified

## File Paths & Previewing Files
- **To preview ANY HTML file in Chrome**, use the `mcp__Control_Chrome__open_url` tool with your local file path
- **The workspace folder IS your local folder** — files written there are immediately accessible
- **DO NOT use localhost HTTP servers** — they are unreliable and unnecessary
- Adjust the file:/// path pattern below to match your local setup:
  - Pattern: `file:///YOUR/LOCAL/PATH/TO/REPO/{project}/{file}`

## Client Work Rule
**Before starting work on ANY client folder**, load the client profile: `memory/clients/{client}.md`. The `Work Locations` table maps every folder where that client's work lives. If no profile exists, create one using `memory/clients/_template.md`.

## Preferences
- Expert-level, production-ready outputs — never placeholder quality
- Values CRO, behavioral psychology, neuromarketing in landing pages
- Run the full workflow: brand extraction → copy creation → expert review panel → deploy
- Expects Skills to be run (unicorn-conversion-engine, expert panels, etc.)
- Parallel execution for speed when possible
- No need to ask for approvals once plan is approved
- All pages must be self-contained single HTML files (inline CSS + JS)
- No external frameworks (no Bootstrap, Tailwind, React)
- No tracking pixels or analytics in the HTML — those get added by the client
- Vanilla JS only — IntersectionObserver, scroll effects, sticky CTAs
